# loan-webapp

A sample loan management application used as a test target for the Playwright E2E framework.

## Overview

Express/TypeScript app served over HTTPS with mutual TLS (mTLS). Manages loan records stored in a shared flat JSON file (`data/loans.json` at the repo root). Notifies the lending-webapp of changes in real time via Webhook + SSE.

- **URL:** `https://localhost:3000`
- **Data store:** `../data/loans.json` (shared with lending-webapp)

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime:** Node.js 22+
- **Framework:** Express.js 5.x
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Template Engine:** EJS
- **Development:** ts-node, nodemon
- **Testing:** Vitest, Supertest
- **Lint/Format:** ESLint (flat config, typescript-eslint), Prettier

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Running

```bash
# Development (hot reload)
npm run dev

# Production
npm run build && npm start
```

## Routes

| Method | Path               | Description                                         |
| ------ | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/`                | Redirects to `/index`                               |
| `GET`  | `/index`           | Dashboard — recent loans grid                       |
| `GET`  | `/loan`            | Loans management page — full loans grid             |
| `POST` | `/loan`            | Create a new loan                                   |
| `POST` | `/loan/:id/delete` | Delete a loan                                       |
| `GET`  | `/loan/api/loans`  | JSON list of all loans                              |
| `GET`  | `/events`          | SSE stream — push `loan-updated` events to browsers |
| `POST` | `/notify`          | Webhook receiver — triggers SSE broadcast           |

## Data Model

Loans are stored in `data/loans.json` (repo root):

```json
[
    {
        "id": "LOAN-20260417-AB12",
        "applicantName": "Jane Smith",
        "amount": 25000,
        "status": "Pending",
        "approver": "John Doe",
        "createdAt": "2026-04-17T10:00:00.000Z"
    }
]
```

Loan ID format: `LOAN-YYYYMMDD-XXXX` (date + 4-char random alphanumeric).

Status values: `New` → `Pending` → `Approved` / `Rejected`

## Real-time Sync

The sync is bidirectional — both apps expose the same `GET /events` (SSE) and `POST /notify` (webhook) pair.

After a loan is created or deleted, this app fires a `POST /notify` to the lending-webapp:

```
POST https://localhost:3001/notify   (local dev)
POST https://lending-webapp:3001/notify  (Docker)
```

The target URL is resolved from `LENDING_WEBAPP_URL` env var, defaulting to `https://localhost:3001`. The receiving app broadcasts a `loan-updated` SSE event which causes all connected browser tabs to reload.

In the other direction, when lending-webapp assigns an approver or approves/rejects a loan, it calls this app's `POST /notify`, and this app's dashboards reload the same way.

## Certificates

Server certificates live in `src/certs/`:

| File              | Purpose                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `server-key.pem`  | Server private key                    |
| `server-cert.pem` | Server certificate                    |
| `client-ca.pem`   | CA used to verify client certs (mTLS) |

`rejectUnauthorized: false` — client cert is requested but not enforced, allowing browser access without a cert during development.

## Running with Docker

Run alongside lending-webapp using Docker Compose from the repo root:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The repo's `data/` folder is bind-mounted at `/app/data` in both containers so they read and write the same `loans.json` as local dev.

## Testing

Unit tests (Vitest + Supertest) cover `src/data/loanStore.ts`, `src/events.ts`, and the routes in
`src/app.ts`. Filesystem and network calls (`fs`, `https`, the data-store modules) are mocked via
`vi.mock`, so tests don't touch the real `data/*.json` files or the network.

```bash
npm test           # run once (used in CI)
npm run test:watch # watch mode
```

E2E tests are handled by [se-harness](https://github.com/rbhattarai/se-harness), a Claude Code plugin whose Playwright MCP test agents drive both apps end to end.

## Linting & Formatting

```bash
npm run lint          # ESLint
npm run lint:fix      # ESLint --fix
npm run format        # Prettier --write
npm run format:check  # Prettier --check (used in CI)
```
